### Directions

1. Create a JS file called `index.js`
2. Create 5 javascript objects that include family members and basic information about them as properties.
    - firstName
    - lastName
    - age
    - favoriteTVShow
    - favoriteSong

3. Put all familyMember objects into an array under the variable name family

4. Write a simple for loop that prints out the name and favoriteSong for each family member when the file loads initially.

5. Write a function that updates the favorite TVShow of the family member once a member of the family is passed in as a function parameter.

6. Update favoriteTVShow on all family members on page load. Print these new favorite shows out to the console.


*BONUS*

Write an additional function that reorders the family array by age of the familyMember
