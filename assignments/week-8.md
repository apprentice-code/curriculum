### Directions

    1. Create a JS file called `index.js`
    2. Include this JS file in an HTML file called `index.html`
    3. In your Javascript file write a function that produces the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in the console from 0 - 500. If the number printed is greater than 500 then the function should stop.

Once you have completed the code do the following:

    1. Open a terminal
    2. `cd ~/workspace/fibonacci`
    3. `git add .`
    4. `git commit -m 'finished the assignment'`
    5. `git push origin master`
