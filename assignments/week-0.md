# Code Apprentice - Assignment Week #0

## Assignment Title: hello-world

## Instructions:

Before you start work on your assignment complete the following steps to get GitHub setup correctly. This is how you will share your work with your mentor and Code Apprentice.

1. Create a new repo in GitHub titled `hello-world` through the github desktop client.
2. Go to the folder where you created the repo on your machine and open it in VS Code.
3. Include a markdown file with your name. This is a test just to make sure that you understand the importance of GitHub. This will also allow the Code Apprentice team to ensure that your account is entered correctly into our system.
4. Once you have done this go to the code in your github desktop application. Press the commit to master button. Now the Code Apprentice admin team and your mentor can see your code on github.
5. Confirm that the code is there by opening a browser and going to http://www.github.com/{githubScreenName}
