### Directions

You're going to create an HTML component to represent a political candidate. Specifically, the representative of your Congressional district. Visit the GovTrack site link below, enter in your home address, and you'll find basic information about your representative.

In your HTML, create an article tag that will serve as your main representative component. Give the element a unique identifier.

1. In this component, create a sub-component for basic information using the section tag. In this section create elements for the representative's image, name, district info, and political affiliation.
2. Beneath the basic information, you will create a sub-component, using a section tag, to list any committees the candidate is serving on.
3. The last component will hold links to any legislation that your representative has enacted.
4. Upload work to GitHub with the repository name of congressional-info. Remember that this name must be spelled correctly and include the same punctuation to receive credit. If you have any questions about this what so ever please reach out via Slack.
