### Directions

1. Create a hangman game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
2. You should only worry about guessing 1 word.
3. The user should be able to enter in a letter.
4. If the letter is correct then it should be filled into the missing spot of the word.
5. If the answer is incorrect then the incorrect guess should be tallied into a different segment on the user interface.
6. Once the user guesses the word correctly they win. Prompt the user that they won with a pop up.
7. If the user has 10 incorrect guesses prompt the user that they lose the game, with a pop up.
8. Be creative.
