### Directions

    1. Create a hangman game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
    2. You should only worry about guessing 1 word.
    3. The user should be able to enter in a letter.
    4. If the letter is correct then it should be filed into the missing spot of the word.
    5. If the answer is incorrect then the incorrect guess should be tallied into a different segment on the user interface.
    6. Once the user guesses the word correct they win. Prompt the user that they won with a pop up.
    7. If the user has 10 incorrect guesses prompt the user that they loss the game, with a pop up.
    8. Be creative.
