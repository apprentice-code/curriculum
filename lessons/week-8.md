# Code Apprentice - Week #8
October 29, 2018 - November 2, 2018 (Charleston County Schools)

## Learning Objectives:
* Students will identify different ways to iterate over data in JavaScript and use conditional logic to branch code paths.

* Students will discuss different data types in Javascript and explain use cases for each native datatype in the programing language.

## Mentor Guided Learning
With your mentee complete the following:

* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 on page load. 
* But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. 

## Assignment

## Extension
- Instead of using traditional loops in javascript explore Higher Order Functions like `Array.map()`, `Array.forEach()`, and `Array.filter()` to complete the exercises for this week.


## Questions
- Can you identify and give examples of three different types of loops in JS? If you can give an example.
